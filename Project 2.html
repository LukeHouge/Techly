						<p>Desktop PCs are cheap but solid machines that can easily be upgraded. Most upgrades focus on components found on your motherboard. These quick tips will give your old, depressing desktop new life.</p></center>

						<h4>Add or replace RAM</h4>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/ram.jpg" alt="ram pic" width="80%" height="80%" /></span>
						<p>Adding RAM is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to speed up your sluggish computer. More RAM allows your computer to do more tasks at once, reducing the amount of time it takes to load.</p>
						<p>If your computer has recently developed problems with connecting to anything, running out of space, or being very noisy, adding new RAM should suffice. If you spend more time fixing your computer rather than using it, it is time to replace your DIMMs entirely. An 8GB upgrade can cost you as ittle as $50.</p>
						<p>Before buying RAM, make sure to check your motherboard's requirements in your manual. You must match the standard (DDR3, DDR4), speed (megahertz), and number of DIMMs (usually between two and eight).</p>
						<p>When adding the new RAM to your computer, check your DIMM slots. In many cases you will have open slots where it is possible directly insert the new RAM. Otherwise, you can replace old DIMMs with new ones.</p>

						<h4>Replace your mechanical drive with an SSD</h4>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/ssd.jpg" alt="ssd pic" width="80%" height="80%" /></span>
						<p>Replacing your old mechanical hard drive with a solid state drive is another easy method for improving your computer. Modern flash storages are much faster than old hard drives. While it is slightly more expensive, prcies are dropping and there are many benefits, including faster boot-ups and general responses.</p>
						<p>Changing the storage drive is slightly more complicated than replacing RAM. You will need to connect the SATA power to the power supply and data cables to the motherboard, then transer your operating drive to a new drive or install a new one. It's a good idea to back up your files to an external drive before the installation process.</p>

						<h4> Get a new graphics card </h4>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/videocard.jpg" alt="video card pic" width="80%" height="80%"/></span>
						<p>All gamers know that having good graphics and running at a high frame rate is necessary for an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, newer more complex games end up running at lower frame rates on your original graphic card. When this starts to become unbearable, it is time for an upgrade. To upgrade your computer, you can either implement multiple GPUs or swap out the old GPU for a brand new one.</p>
