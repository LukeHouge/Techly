						<h3>Step 1: Parts needed</h3>
						<span class="image left"><img height=350 img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>To build a computer you will need to first get a some essential parts, you can find a list of these parts below. 
							<li> Case for your computer</li>
							<li> Motherboard </li>
							<li> Central Processing Unit also known as a CPU </li>
							<li> Random Access Memory sticks also known as RAM </li>
							<li> Graphics Processing Unit also known as a GPU </li>
							<li> Power Supply Unit </li>
							<li> Storage in the form of SSD's or Hard Drives </li>
							<li> You will also need a screw driver to connect some parts </li>
							<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these parts work together to create a working computer. The motherboard connects all the other parts together. The CPU is the brains of the computer, it makes all the decisions and is used to run all your programs. The RAM stores information for your CPU the more RAM you have the faster your computer will run. A GPU is used to render all 3D graphic, basically what shows up on your screen. The GPU wont always be required if your CPU has integrated graphics which many currently do as well as your motherboard supports integrated graphics. The power supply unit is exactly what it sounds like, it is used to give power to your computer. The storage is used for exactly that, whenever you need to save something it goes to your storage devices. SSD's are typically faster but also cost more than regular hard drives. The case is what all of these parts are going to be stored in, depending on what size motherboard you have you can get a smaller or bigger case. Now that you know all the parts you need as well as a general description of what each item does you can move on to how to build your computer.
