						<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we jump into building your computer, there are a few precautions to know about. One of the most common problems that occur when building a computer is static electricty, which ruins electronic parts. Luckily, there are multiple simple solutions to this, such as the anti-static wristband. This wristband should be worn on the non-dominant hand and connected to the computer case. Many parts will come in an anti-staic bag, these can come in hnady so you should never throw them away. its smart to keep the parts in their bags until your ready to use them to prevent the from getting runied. A good rule rule for building computers is to avoid carpets at all costs, since it produces a large amount of static electricity. <br> <br>  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also be careful with cords. Never plug the power supply into an outlet until your are completed building your computer. Its also smart to wait to plug in your keyboards and mouse until after your finished building. When handleing parts with printed circuit boards (PCB) such as the RAM, graphics card, and motherboard you never want to touch the pins. instead you should only touch the PCB edges as these wont be ruined by fingerprints and a bit of force.

                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you have your materials and a safe spot to work, you can finally start assembling the PC. First, get your case and power supply out. Most cases have a panel on the left side which can be removed with either a screwdriver or your hands. Take this panel off and place it to the side until you are finished building the rest of the computer. Second, find where the power supply goes in your specific case. It will most likely be at the top or bottom left corner. if not its very easy to find by looking for a square opening where your PSU will fit. Once you find where the power supply goes, screw it into the square opening with the included screws. Depending on which type of PSU you have (standard or modular) the cables will either be connected or seperate and detachable. If you have a modular PSU you can detatch these cables and then plug them in at the end once your computer is build. If not then its reccomended to keep these cables bundled up and away from any other parts of the computer until you are ready to plug everything in.

                        <h3 id="part4"> Part 4: Installing the CPU, Cooler, and RAM </h3>
						<hr>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before installing the motherboard it is smart to put in the main components of the motherboard. These include the CPU, Cooler, and RAM. First up is the CPU. Depending on if you have an intel or amd chip these step can be slightly different. Both have similar steps but we will go over some differences when installing them below. </p>
                        
                        <h5>Installing a Intel CPU</h5>
                        
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing an intel CPU is more simple then a AMD install but this doesnt mean you shouldnt be careful. Installing a CPU is one of the more difficult steps when building a computer since it requires you to be very careful. You are going to start by opening the load plate. to do this you will push down gently on the load arm and move it out sideways from under the hook, and then lift it up all the way. The lever action of the hook will open the plate, which you can easily flip up. If itâ€™s a new motherboard, there may be a plastic or foam filler in the socket, which you can gently remove. Your CPU itself should have two small notches cut out of it, directly across from each other on the chip. With the contacts facing down, there should be only one direction where the notches will line up with the notches in the socket. You will want to gently set this in the socket so it lines up perfectly. You dont need to put any pressure when placing in it as it will automatically set in and lock in once you put the load arm back in place. To do this you will need to take the load arm and push it down over the CPU and lock it back into the hook till you hear a click, this will take a good ammount of pressure to do so you will want to make sure the CPU is placed in perfectly before attempting this. </p>
                        
                        <h5>Installing an AMD CPU</h5>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing an AMD CPU is fairly similar to an intel chip with the major difference being that the pins are actually on the CPU and have to be installed into the socket with a bit more pressure to fit. You are going to do some of the same steps as you would on an Intel chip such as opening the socket and removing the plastic or foam filler. After this you are going to want to look for a golden triangle on the CPU. This triangle lines up with the triangle in the socket and you are going to place it pin down where the 2 triangles would connect. Now again you are going to want to put the load arm back on to tighten and secure the CPU. It takes more pressure to accomplish this with an AMD chip so be sure to continue pushing until you hear a click. </p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h4> Cooling your CPU</h4>
			<span class="image left"><img src="http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/pc-buildout-2016-cpu-coolre-720x480-c.jpg" alt="ram pic" width="80%" height="80%" /></span>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, now you can start the installation of your cooler. Luckily this is a fairly easy task to do. If you are using the cooler that came with your cpu its hardly any work at all, your going to gently place it on top of your cpu and screw it in to place so that the logo is facing properly when the case is standing up. If you are using an aftermarket cooler you will be required to put on thermal paste, no worries though this is a fairly simple task aswell, all you have to do is get a small drop and place it in the center of your cooler so that it will connect to the CPU. Once its connected to the CPU the thermal paste will eventually spread out till there a small layer all across the cooler. The reason for this thermal paste is that it allows for heat to flow trough from your CPU into the cooler.Make sure to screw it in and then after this is all done you are going to want to take to cooler cable and plug it into the motherboard in the slot labeled "CPU-fan".
              
                            <br>
                        <h4> locking in the RAM</h4>
			<span class="image right"><img src="http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/pc-buildout-2016-ram-720x480-c.jpg" alt="ram pic" width="80%" height="80%" /></span>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to probably the easiest step of the whole build, putting in the RAM. All this requires is for you to know which direction and slot to put the RAM in. For direction all you need to do is find a hole in the contacts of your RAM and then face that towards the bottom of the motherboard to make sure it matches up with a block in the RAM holder that will fit into the hole. Figuring out the right slots to put your RAM in can be more difficult as it depends on how many sticks of RAM you have aswell as the brand and type of RAM. If you only have 1 stick of ram then its easy, all you do is put it in the A1 slot. If you have 2 sticks that are identical to eachother you will want to place it in the slots that are matching in color which will be A1 and B1. The reason for this is that your system will then make these sticks of RAM act like a single stick. If you have 2 different sticks of RAM you will want to place them in A1 and A2 since your system will not be able to read 1 of them if it is placed in B1. After you have figured out the direction and slot that works for your stick or sticks of RAM all you have to do is push them in until you hear a click. and the "wings" at the end lock in. There are little flaps near the end of the ram stick called wings that should lock into place if you have pushed in the ram correctly. After this is done your RAM should be good to work as soon as you connect your motherboard so lets do that next.

                        <h3 id="part5">Part 5: Putting your motherboard in the case</h3>
						<hr>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing your motherboard is a pretty simple task but it can be hard to explain as it changes depending on your case and motherboard. Generally you case will have a built in "Stand-Off", this is a gap between the back of your case and where you will place your motherboard used to give some cooling. If this isnt already installed it will be in the box your case came in and you will have to manually screw it in. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up you have to figure out what way to put in your motherboard. Depending on your case it will be either at the back, front, or top of the case. You can figure out this position by looking for a rectangular cut out in your case. This cut out if for a peice called the "I/O Sheild", this will come packaged with your motherboard. You will want to screw this in before moving on. Now you should be good to install your motherboard. Your going to want to line it up so the screw holes match up the stand-off and I/O shield. you may have to wiggle it a bit but you will know its the correct postition if the motherboard snaps into place. Now you just have to screw the motherboard into the stand-off and sheild to secure it into place.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this is complete you are going to plug in some cables including the power cable which will power the mothermoard and the CPU. This cable will most likely already be in your motherboard and you will just have to plug it into the power supple. Some other things you may have to plug into the motherboard are the cables for power and rest buttons, LED's, and USB ports. Installing these cables is also very simple, just find the matching labels on the cable and plug them into the motherboard. To find out how to plug these in more acuratly you can look at the manual that came with your motherboard as it will be more accurate for your specific motherboard.

						<h3 id="part6">Part 6: Installing the GPU</h3>
						<hr>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/installingGPU.jpg" alt="ram pic" width="80%" height="80%" /></span>
						<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether your CPU doesnt come with integrated graphics or you just want to get an imporved GPU to play games the first step is choosing a graphics card from the thousands of options available. The hardest part of installing a GPU can actually be just picking one out. With thousands of different sizes, capabilities, looks, and ovbiously price points it can be tough to find the perfect one for you. There are 2 different companies that manufacture GPU's, Nvidia and AMD. On top of this mutiple other companies make their own version of these 2 companies GPU's so which is the right choice for you? Well this can come down to what your personal preference and your price point so always research before deciding which is right for you. For this tutorial we are going to assume you have already picked out a GPU that works for you. 
							<br>
							<br>
							&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most graphics cards will simply fit into a PCle slot on your motherboard, these can most commonly be found resting under your cpu. They are long and slim connectors, and there are usually 4 of them in a row. To the left of the PCle slots will be the back of your case where there will be a row of thin metal brackets that can be removed with a screwdriver. depending on the size of these you will have to remove one or two for each graphics card you have. You can figure this out by simply looking at how big your GPU is compared to these metal slots and removing them until your GPU fits inbetween them. </p>
