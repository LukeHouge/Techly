						<h4>To build a computer you will first need to get these essential parts: </h4>
						<p>	
							<li> Computer case - what all the parts are going to be stored in. Case sizes vary based on the size of your motherboard. </li>
							<li> Motherboard - the circuit board contiaining principle components of a computer and connections to other circuit boards.</li>
							<li> Central Processing Unit (CPU) - the brains of the computer. It makes all the decisions and is used to run all your programs.</li>
							<li> Random Access Memory sticks (RAM) - stores information for your CPU. The more RAM you have the faster your computer will run.</li>
							<li> Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) - used to render all 3D graphics. </li>
							<li> Power Supply Unit - used to give power to your computer. </li>
							<li> Storage (SSDs or Hard Drives) - used for saving files and software to your computer. SSDs are typically faster but cost more than regular hard drives. </li> </p>

						<h3>Step 2: Precautions</h3>
						<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we jump into building your computer, there are a few precautions to know about. One of the most common problems that occur when building a computer is static electricty, which ruins electronic parts. Luckily, there are multiple simple solutions to this, such as the anti-static wristband. This wristband should be worn on the non-dominant hand and connected to the computer case. The rule for building computers is to avoid carpets at all costs, since it produces a large amount of static electricity.

                        <h3> Step 3: Preparing the case and power supply </h3>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you have your materials and a safe spot to work, you can finally start assembling the PC. First, get your case and power supply out. Most cases have a panel on the left side which can be removed with either a screwdriver or your hands. Take this panel off and place it to the side until you are finished building the rest of the computer. Second, find where the power supply goes in your specific case. It will most likely be in one of the corners. Once you find where the power supply goes, screw it into the square opening. Make sure to leave the cables hanging out for later.

                        <h3> Step 4: Installing the CPU, Cooler, and RAM </h3>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before installing the motherboard it is smart to put in the main components of the motherboard. These include the CPU, Cooler, and RAM. First up is the CPU. Depending on if you have an intel or amd chip these step can be slightly different. Both have similar steps but we will go over some differences when installing them below. </p>
                        
                        <h5>Installing a Intel CPU</h5>
                        
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing an intel CPU is more simple then a AMD install but this doesnt mean you shouldnt be careful. Installing a CPU is one of the more difficult steps when building a computer since it requires you to be very careful. You are going to start by opening the load plate. to do this you will push down gently on the load arm and move it out sideways from under the hook, and then lift it up all the way. The lever action of the hook will open the plate, which you can easily flip up. If itâ€™s a new motherboard, there may be a plastic or foam filler in the socket, which you can gently remove. Your CPU itself should have two small notches cut out of it, directly across from each other on the chip. With the contacts facing down, there should be only one direction where the notches will line up with the notches in the socket. You will want to gently set this in the socket so it lines up perfectly. You dont need to put any pressure when placing in it as it will automatically set in and lock in once you put the load arm back in place. To do this you will need to take the load arm and push it down over the CPU and lock it back into the hook till you hear a click, this will take a good ammount of pressure to do so you will want to make sure the CPU is placed in perfectly before attempting this. </p>
                        
                        <h5>Installing an AMD CPU</h5>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing an AMD CPU is fairly similar to an intel chip with the major difference being that the pins are actually on the CPU and have to be installed into the socket with a bit more pressure to fit. You are going to do some of the same steps as you would on an Intel chip such as opening the socket and removing the plastic or foam filler. After this you are going to want to look for a golden triangle on the CPU. This triangle lines up with the triangle in the socket and you are going to place it pin down where the 2 triangles would connect. Now again you are going to want to put the load arm back on to tighten and secure the CPU. It takes more pressure to accomplish this with an AMD chip so be sure to continue pushing until you hear a click. </p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h4> Cooling your CPU</h4>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, after the installation of your CPU comes the installation of the cooler. Luckily this is a fairly easy task to do. If you are using the cooler that came with your cpu its hardly any work at all, your going to gently place it on top of your cpu and screw it in to place so that the logo is facing properly when the case is standing up. If you are using an aftermarket cooler this task is a bit more difficult as you will be required to put on thermal paste. No worries though this is a fairly simple task aswell, all you have to do is get a small drop the size of a pea and place it directly in the center of your cooler so that it will connect to the CPU. Once its connected to the CPU the thermal paste will eventually spread out till there a small layer all across the cooler. The reason for this thermal paste is that it allows for heat to flow trough from your CPU into the cooler. Once again with an aftermarket cooler you are going to want to screw it into place the same way as you would a stock cooler. After this is all done you are going to want to take to cooler cable and plug it into the motherboard in the slot labeled "CPU-fan".
                            
                         <span> <center> <img id="img80" src=" http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/pc-buildout-2016-cpu-coolre-720x480-c.jpg" width=80% height=80%/> </center></span>
                            <br>
                        <h4> locking in the RAM</h4>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to probably the easiest step of the whole build, putting in the RAM. All this requires is for you to know which direction and slot to put the RAM in. For direction all you need to do is find a hole in the contacts of your RAM and then face that towards the bottom of the motherboard to make sure it matches up with a block in the RAM holder that will fit into the hole. Figuring out the right slots to put your RAM in can be more difficult as it depends on how many sticks of RAM you have aswell as the brand and type of RAM. If you only have 1 stick of ram then its easy, all you do is put it in the A1 slot. If you have 2 sticks that are identical to eachother you will want to place it in the slots that are matching in color which will be A1 and B1. The reason for this is that your system will then make these sticks of RAM act like a single stick. If you have 2 different sticks of RAM you will want to place them in A1 and A2 since your system will not be able to read 1 of them if it is placed in B1. After you have figured out the direction and slot that works for your stick or sticks of RAM all you have to do is push them in until you hear a click and the "wings" at the lock in.
