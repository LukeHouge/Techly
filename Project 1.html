						<h3>Step 1: Parts needed</h3>
						<img src="images/parts.png" alt="parts image" width="100%" height="50%">
						<center> <h4>To build a computer you will need to first get some essential parts, you can find a list of these below. </h4> </center>
						<p>	
							<li> Case for your computer</li>
							<li> Motherboard </li>
							<li> Central Processing Unit (CPU) </li>
							<li> Random Access Memory sticks (RAM) </li>
							<li> Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) </li>
							<li> Power Supply Unit </li>
							<li> Storage in the form of SSD's or Hard Drives </li>
							<li> Screw driver </li>
							<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these parts work together to create a working computer. The motherboard connects all the other parts together. The CPU is the brains of the computer, it makes all the decisions and is used to run all your programs. The RAM stores information for your CPU, the more RAM you have the faster your computer will run. A GPU is used to render all 3D graphics, basically what will shwo up on your screen. The GPU wont always be required if your CPU has integrated graphics which many currently do as well as your motherboard supports integrated graphics.The power supply unit is exactly what it sounds like, it is used to give power to your computer. The storage is needed for your computer to save files and software. SSD's are typically faster but also cost more than regular hard drives. The case is what all of these parts are going to be stored in, depending on what size motherboard you have you can get a smaller or bigger case. Now that you know all the parts you need as well as a general description of what each item does you can move on to how to build your computer.

						<h3>Step 2: Before starting</h3>
						<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we jump into building your computer there are a few precautions you should know about. One of the most common problems that occur when building a computer is static electricty ruining your computer parts. Luckily there are a few simple solutions to this such as buying a anti-static wristband. This is a wristband where one part wraps around your wrist and the other to the case of them computer. It will make sure that your computer isnt destroyed from static electricity. Another simple rule when building computers is to never work on carpet. These produce a lot of static electricity so it is usually smart to avoid them at all cost. A good reccomendation would be working on a table or a tile floor.

                        <h3> Step 3: Starting to build </h3>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you have all your parts and have a safe spot to work you can finally start assembling the PC. You want to first start by getting your case and power supply out. Most cases have a panel on the left side which can be removed with either a screwdriver or with just your hands, your going to want to take this panel off and place it to the side until you are finished building the computer. Second you are going to want to find where the power supply goes in your specific case, it will most likely be in one of the corners of the case. Once you find where the power supply goes you are simply going to put the power supply there and screw it in to the side where the cut out for it is. You will also want to leave the cables hanging out so you can connect them to the other parts later.</p>
