	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid cooling is something that is considered taboo for many people, to difficult to implement, too dangerous to attempt, and not necessary. One of those is true depending on how you look at it and which benefits matter to you, the others are simply untrue. Before even talking about why water cooling is useful, we need to understand how it works. This boils down to the laws of thermodynamics. If you have studied chemistry you will be acquainted with the term specific heat. The specific heat of a given substance is characterized as such: specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise 1g of a substance 1Â°C. Therefore, a substance having a higher specific heat would require <i>more</i> energy to raise the temperature the same amount as a substance with a lower specific heat. Given that water has a specific heat about 4 times that of air, significantly more energy, or average kinetic energy (also known as temperature) is required to change its temperature. This is the crux of water cooling and why it works. Because water cooling works by, at a basic level, pumping water past your components to keep them cool, using water which stays cooler easier than air is evidently more efficient.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we understand how water cooling is more efficient we can talk about its advantages and disadvantages.

		</table>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the biggest advantage to water cooling, in my mind, is the looks. The visual appeal that can be created by water cooling cannot be matched or replicated in any other way, the results are simply stunning if done correctly and adequate effort is applied. The second main advantage is that is you want the absolute best performance you simply need to water cool, and do it with a custom loop. You can honestly get some killer performance from air cooling, it works for over 90% of computers live today. However if you need the absolute most performance, only to be achieved by overclocking, you need to water cool. overclocking for the uninitiated is raising the power input and performance thresholds for your various chips (CPU, GPU, RAM) above their factory defaults. These defaults are set to match the thermal capacity of the product. This is why more expensive graphics cards cost more and are larger, they use larger cooling apparatuses to slow for a higher clock. If you want to take these limits to the extreme you will exceed what you can cool by air and will need to water cool. You could use an AIO (all in one cooler), but those use at most a 280mm radiator (more on that later) and simply do not have the thermal capacity for the most extreme applications. Thus, a custom loop to the resue. Also, if you are building a custom PC, the status quo effectively forces you to water cool, since all high end build utilize this method and no serious PC does not. Finally water cooling allows for quieter operation. Because you are passing water through a radiator, you can use large radiators with larger surface area, and more fans spinning slower. To achieve the same performance with air cooling you need the one or two fans you can fit on a small heatsink to be spinning very fast, which creates noise. Three fans spinning at slow RPMs are quieter than one fan spinning at high revolutions.
		<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the disadvantages. Like every custom project, this will involve time and effort. This is the major hurdle for most people, they just do not understand how it is done or are afraid to break their build. Water cooling will take significant planning, assembly, and maintenance over time, but the results to many are worth it. The other disadvantage is the price. For $20 you can get a fantastic air cooler (such as the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO). This is a killer heatsink and will allow you to get some decent overclocks. Water cooling, however, can cost a lot of money once all the parts are purchased, and effectively will only grant you a marginal performance gain. 
		<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you understand the concept and are aware of the disadvantages it is time to learn how to actually plan and build your loop.

					<p>NOW that you have an awesome and entirely custom loop gracing your PC build it is time to take your build to the next level. One thing you may have noticed from all of the examples is that they had custom and matching cables. Not only does this create a cohesive flow in your theme but also is a good skill to have. Click below to learn how to lay out and actually create from scratch your own computer cables complete with sleeving! </p>
