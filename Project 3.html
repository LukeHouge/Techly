							<b><center><p width="80%">This particular build is an incredible example of what can be done, and the stunning visual appeal that can be created. The builder custom made a reservoir to highlight the dual nature his loop with two different colored coolants.</b></center>			
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid cooling is something that is considered taboo for many people, to difficult to implement, too dangerous to attempt, and not necessary. One of those is true depending on how you look at it and which benefits matter to you, the others are simply untrue. Before even talking about why water cooling is useful, we need to understand how it works. This boils down to the laws of thermodynamics. If you have studied chemistry you will be acquainted with the term specific heat. The specific heat of a given substance is characterized as such: specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise 1g of a substance 1Â°C. Therefore, a substance having a higher specific heat would require <i>more</i> energy to raise the temperature the same amount as a substance with a lower specific heat. Given that water has a specific heat about 4 times that of air, significantly more energy, or average kinetic energy (also known as temperature) is required to change its temperature. This is the crux of water cooling and why it works. Because water cooling works by, at a basic level, pumping water past your components to keep them cool, using water which stays cooler easier than air is evidently more efficient.
	<br><br>
	Now that we understand how water cooling is more efficient we can talk about its advantages and disadvantages. 
		<br><br><table>
			<tr>
				<th>Advantages</th>
					<th>Disadvantages</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>Higher cooling cap city</li>
						<li>Quieter operation</li>

		&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the biggest advantage to water cooling, in my mind, is the looks. The visual appeal that can be created by water cooling cannot be matched or replicated in any other way, the results are simply stunning if done correctly and adequate effort is applied. The second main advantage is that is you want the absolute best performance you simply need to water cool, and do it with a custom loop. You can honestly get some killer performance from air cooling, it works for over 90% of computers live today. However if you need the absolute most performance, only to be achieved by overclocking, you need to water cool. overclocking for the uninitiated is raising the power input and performance thresholds for your various chips (CPU, GPU, RAM) above their factory defaults. These defaults are set to match the thermal capacity of the product. This is why more expensive graphics cards cost more and are larger, they use larger cooling apparatuses to slow for a higher clock. If you want to take these limits to the extreme you will exceed what you can cool by air and will need to water cool. You could use an AIO (all in one cooler), but those use at most a 280mm radiator (more on that later) and simply do not have the thermal capacity for the most extreme applications. Thus, a custom loop to the rescue. Also, if you are building a custom PC, the status quo effectively forces you to water cool, since all high end build utilize this method and no serious PC does not. Finally water cooling allows for quieter operation. Because you are passing water through a radiator, you can use large radiators with larger surface area, and more fans spinning slower. To achieve the same performance with air cooling you need the one or two fans you can fit on a small heatsink to be spinning very fast, which creates noise. Three fans spinning at slow RPMs are quieter than one fan spinning at high revolutions.
		<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the disadvantages. Like every custom project, this will involve time and effort. This is the major hurdle for most people, they just do not understand how it is done or are afraid to break their build. Water cooling will take significant planning, assembly, and maintenance over time, but the results to many are worth it. The other disadvantage is the price. For $20 you can get a fantastic air cooler (such as the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO). This is a killer heatsink and will allow you to get some decent overclocks. Water cooling, however, can cost a lot of money once all the parts are purchased, and effectively will only grant you a marginal performance gain. 
		<br><br>Now that you understand the concept and are aware of the disadvantages it is time to learn how to actually plan and build your loop.

						<b><center><p width="80%">To build a custom loop you will need many parts, in fact you will probably need more parts for your loop than you did for your entire build. First I will start out by listing general categories and then going more in depth.</p></b></center>
						<h4>Water Blocks</h4>
						 <img class="image left" src="images/wcwaterblock.jpg" alt="wcwaterblock" width="100%" height="100%">
						<p>Water blocks are the heart of a liquid cooling build, they are what the cooled water is actually pumped through. Water blocks are made for many different parts of the build, but only a few are necessary:
						<ul>
							<li><b>CPU Blocks- </b> these are the most important as the CPU needs to be cooled the most since it all high end CPUs will not include a cooler and will likely be overclocked the most</li>
							<li><b>GPU Blocks-</b>Graphics cards produce the most amount of heat, and therefore it may be nice to water cool them. However, if you bought a high end graphics card, it likely already has a great stock cooler and may not need water cooling unless you will be utilizing high overclocks.</li> 
							<br><br><blockquote>This brings up another advantage to water cooling- the thermal output by each component is less. What this means is that even if a graphics card has a very beefy cooler already and might not need the liquid cooling to keep its thermals under control, water cooling may still be necessary for thermal output concerns. Graphics cards output <b>a lot</b> of heat, especially with air coolers equipped with fans. In a high end build Crossfire of SLI is likely going to be used, and having 3 graphics cards stuck right next to each other means an extremely large c concentration of heat on those chips. Liquid cooling can remove some of the thickness spreading them apart and leaving them room to breath, but also collects the heat into the water instead of the air around the cards. </blockquote>
							<li><b>Motherboard Blocks- </b>Motherboards can also be cooled. These water blocks can be sold as all-in-one (full cover) blocks, or as separate blocks. The water cooled parts of a motherboard are the same parts the factory cooling solution covers. This is typically the south bridge (PCH) chip, and the power control (VRM / MOSFETs) modules. Water cooling a motherboard is often more for aesthetic reasons, but can help with thermals.</li>
							<li><b>RAM Blocks- </b>Memory sticks can also be water cooled, but really do not need to be unless you are trying to achieve very high overclocks, and really it just looks cooler than is	 really necessary. 
							<li><b>SSD Blocks- </b>SSDs are the last component that is common to be water cooled. This is the least common as it really is unnecessary.

						<h4>Fans/Radiators</h4>
						<img src="images/wcradiator.jpg" alt="wcradiator" width="100%" height="100%" class="image right">
						<p>The <b>radiator</b>, coupled with its attached fans, is what actually keeps the water cool as it flows through your loop.  As the liquid flows through the copper tubing, the radiator fins absorb the heat from the water, then the fins are cooled by the fans attached to the radiator. Radiators come in multiple sizes, usually designed for a certain number of fans. For example, a 120mm radiator holds 1 120mm fan, and a 280mm radiator holds 2 140mm fans. Radiators can come in sizes large enough to accommodate 4 fans. The larger and thicker the radiator, the more effectively it will be able to dissipate heat. The amount of cooling capacity you have is dependent on the amount of radiators you can fit in your case. Make sure to choose a case that can fit the number of radiators you need (<a href="https://www.ekwb.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-a-case-for-liquid-cooling/">use this guide for help</a>). Use this rough guide to determine how many radiators you need (keep in mind that if you have a high end card, or are trying to achieve high overclocks you may want more radiators and fans, some high end builds use a double radiator per device)
							<div class="box"><ul>
								<li>1 device = 1 fan radiator</li>
								<li>2 devices = 2 fan radiator</li>
								<li>3 devices = 3 fan radiator</li>
								<li>4 devices = 4 fan radiator</li>
								<li>5+ devices = larger than 4 fans, or use multiple radiators</li>
							</ul></div>
							A common rule of thumb that has been passed around the online forums is that you should dedicate 120mm (or 140mm) of radiator space per component that is to be cooled, with an additional 120mm (or 140mm) of radiator space if you are going to be overclocking. Following this rule means that youâd have to dedicate 240mm of radiator space to a single overclocked component (which you can see in the picture above), 360mm of radiator space for two overclocked components, and so on.
							These are only recommendations. The "correct" option is based on your desired temperature and noise range. Some people may want to cool 4 video cards with a 3-fan radiator by accepting a somewhat higher temperature range, and/or by running the fans faster. However, if you want them to run cooler, will be running high overclocks, or run the fans slower (meaning quieter operation) you may want a 4-fan or even 2 double-fan radiators for the 4 cards. <br><br>
							<img src="images/wcfans.jpg" alt="wcfans" width="100%" height="100%" class="image left">
							<h5>CFM vs. Static Pressure</h5>Another consideration is the fans, and the <b>FPI (fin per inch)</b> measurement on the radiator. The higher the FPI the more dense the radiator fins are, and the more static pressure is needed. This brings us to types of fans. There are two types of fans, those optimized for <b>air flow</b> (volume of air a fan can move, measured in CFM) and <b>static pressure</b>. Fans optimized for air flow are measured for the amount of air a fan can move when <i>no obstacles are in the way</i> This is why static pressure fans are so important. Static pressure fans are slightly different and are designed to overpower obstacles, such as the fins on a radiator. Air flow optimized fans can be used for water cooling, but only for radiators with a low fin density. For radiators with high fin density you need static pressure fans, as described below:
							<br><br>
							<div class="box"><ol>
								<li>Emphasize cooling performance and opt for the largest, highest fin density radiator allowable. Pair it with high static pressure fans. Generally, 120mm fans push more air than 140mm fans, but look at the Pa measurements however for exact values</li>
								<li>Emphasize lower noise levels by selecting a lower fin density radiator. Use medium airflow fans, or use a fan controller or PWM fans to slow down high airflow ones (<a href="https://www.ekwb.com/blog/what-is-pwm-and-how-does-it-work/">look here on a guide to PWM fans)</a>. Generally, 140mm fans are quieter than 120mm fans.</li>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
									<center><h5>Soft Tubing</h5>
									<img src="images/wcsofttubing.jpg" width="80%" height="120px" id="img80"></center>
									<br><p>Soft tubing is made out of norprene, rubber, silicone, and PVC most often. It comes in clear, and colored variants variants; and you can even get UV reactive tubing. The quality of tubing matters as the lower quality tubing can become discolored and yellow, or loose its transparency. One problem with soft tubing is that it can kink with tight bends, but anti-kink cables can rectify this. Soft tubing is nice to use, and better for those first building a loop. The reason is that it is flexible, and easy to bend, as well as easy to cut. You can just hold it up to the fittings you want to connect, and then cut it to that length. While soft tubing is easy to install, it doesn't have the same clean look that you get from hard, straight tubing.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
									<center><h5>Hard Tubing</h5>
									<img src="images/wchardtubing.jpg" width="80%" height="120px" id="img80"></center>
									<br><p>Hard tubing is usually made of acrylic (plexi glass) or PETG (polyethylene terephthalate). Hard tubing is harder to use, as you need careful consideration for every tube. Hard tubing needs to be measured out exactly, and bent using a heat gun precisely. If you bend the tube incorrectly it can look messy, or not fit the run you are trying to tube. You can also use right angle fittings if you do not want to bend the tube. Another form of hard tubing is copper tubing. This can be painted, and has a different look than clear PETG or acrylic tubing, although it is more difficult to work with and bend. Hard tubing offers a clean and aesthetically pleasing look, which is why you will see it more in high end builds.</p>
