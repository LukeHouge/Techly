						<!--Yo brandon, if you want pictures to the left or the right, I left an example with the heat gun. just copy the code and change to image left or right, and then change the src to the picture you want.-->

						<h3 id="part1">Part 1: What is sleeving</h3>	
						
						<center><img id="img80" height="80%" width=80% src="images/sleeving.jpg"></center>
							<p>While custom sleeving may not bring a massive boost in performance such as an upgrade to the CPU or GPU, or a significant reduction in fan noise such as a switch to a water cooling system, custom sleeving your cables is the definitive way towards a well organized, clean, and personalized computer. Sleeved cables neaten up the interior of your build and are a crucial component in the overall color scheme of the computer.</p>
							<p>While the basics of sleeving are easily learned, the job can quickly increase in time and complexity depending on the size of your job. In this guide, we will show you the materials required for a custom sleeving job as well as the basic methods of applying sleeve.
						<hr>
						<h3 id="part2">Part 2: Materials/Tools</h3>
						<center><img id="img80" height="60%" width=60% src="images/SleevingKit.jpg"></center>
						<p>Premade custom sleeving kits are available from certain manufacturers, for example this neon green custom sleeving kit from Kobra System. While kits like these usually include all the materials needed to complete a job, many tools inside the kit can be replaced by tools that are already available to you around the house.
						<p><b>Sleeving -</b> Different types of sleeving exist, including Paracord 550, MDPC-X Sleeve, and TechFlex or FlexoPET. We recommend Paracord 550 due to its relative cheapness</p>
						<center><img id="img80" height="40%" width=40% src="images/sleevingtypes.jpg"></center>
						<p><b>Heat Shrink -</b> Evenly cut into 15-20mm sections</p>
						<center><img src="images/heatshrink.jpg" id="img80" width="40%" height="40%"></center>
						<p><b>Screwdrivers -</b> Used to get around your computer</p>
						<p><b>Tape Measure/Ruler -</b> From measuring lengths of cables to lengths of paracord, accuracy is key</p>
						<p><b>Cutting Utensils -</b> A pair of scissors or an X-Acto Knife are crucial</p>
						<p><b>Tape -</b> Useful for preparing the ends of cables so that they don't catch on the inside of our sleeving material</p>
						<p><b>Heating Element -</b> A heat gun, lighter, or a hair dryer are needed in order to make heat shrink function properly</p>

						<!--TODO: Make pics to right/left so that they dont look as messy. Totally forgot how to do that, oops.-->

						<h3 id="part3">Part 3: Before starting</h3>
						<center><img src="images/pcieplug1.jpg" id="img80" width="60%" height="60%"></center>
						<p>Before we can begin sleeving our cables, we must first remove the cables from their plugs and prepare them for sleeving.</p>
						<center><img src="images/removingcables.jpg" id="img80" width="40%" height="40%"></center>
						<p>First, remove the cables individually from their respective ports in the plug. Make sure to keep track of which cables go to which port with a pin diagram (see below). While doing this, cut any zip ties to free up all the cables.</p>
						<center><img src="images/pindiagram.png" id="img80" width="40%" height="40%"></center>
						<br>
						<center><img src="images/preparedcables.jpg" id="img80" width="40%" height="40%"></center>
						<p>After removing all the cables, tape the ends off in order to prevent the tips from catching on the inside of your sleeving material. They should look like the cables in the picture above.</p>
						
						<hr>
						<h3 id="part4">Part 4: Starting to sleeve</h3>
						
						<center><img id="img80" height="80%" width=80% src="images/picoffinishedsleeving.jpg"></center>
						<p>After the cables have been prepared, measure out lengths of sleeving material equivalent to the lengths of your cables. Begin threading your cables through the sleeving material until the end of the cable begins to show on the other side.</p>
						<p>Repeat this for the other cables that you wish to sleeve.</p>
						
						<center><img id="img80" height="40%" width=40% src="images/finishedsleeving.jpg"></center>
						<p>Your cables should all look like this after finishing.</p>
						<p>Align a section of heat shrink with the end of the cable like so.</p>
						<center><img id="img80" height="40%" width=40% src="images/alignedheatshrink.jpg"></center>
						
						<p>After aligning the heat shrink with the end of your cables, use your heat source (heat gun, lighter, or hair dryer) and run it along the heat shrink so that it tightens and secures the sleeving to the cable.</p>
						<center><img id="img80" height="40%" width=40% src="images/finishedheatshrink.jpg"></center>
						<p>Repeat this so that all your cables look like this.</p>
						
						<p>After completing all your cables, start plugging the back into the plug according to the pin diagram you created earlier.</p>
						<center><img id="img80" height="40%" width=40% src="images/cablesbackinplug.jpg"></center>
						
						<hr>
						<h3 id="part5">Part 5: Finishing Sleeving</h3>
						<img src="images/completedbundle.jpg" alt="Organize to your taste" class="image right" id="img80" width="40%" height="40%">
						<p>If you have followed these steps correctly, you should have a completed bundle of sleeved cables. You can now organize them according to color, straighten them, and shape them any way you please with the help of a couple of zip ties.</p>
